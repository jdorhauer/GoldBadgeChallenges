# Gold Badge Challenges

## About

These challenges respond to prompts included as .txt files. They are built to display the ability to understand and use C# to design a basic console application.

They were created as part of the program at [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://elevenfifty.org/).

The prompt is in the base folder with the repository for the project. They involve challenges such as creating a menu, create a badge application, and others.

Each challenge includes a series of unit tests that have been run on the project.

## Viewing Challenges

In order to view these applications, download the file, and run locally. I am currently exploring the possibility of purchasing a domain and displaying these challenges and other projects on that domain.
