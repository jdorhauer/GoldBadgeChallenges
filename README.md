# GoldBadgeChallenges

These challenges respond to prompts included as .txt files. They are built to display the ability to understand and use C# to design a basic console application.

The prompt is in the base folder with the repository for the project. They involve challenges such as creating a menu, create a badge application, and others.

Each challenge includes a series of tests that have been run on the project.
